//Create a new user object named joe. On this object, create a name key with the value being "Joe" and an age key with the value being 50.
//Add a method on joe called setAge that, when invoked, will take in a newAge parameter and change age to newAge.

var joe = {
	name: "Joe",

//Now invoke the method to change the age value to 40.
//Invoke it again to change the age to 20.

joe.setAge(40);

joe.setAge(20);




//Create a function called returnName that will return any user object's name.
//Hint: use the this keyword

function returnName() {
	return this.name;

//On the line below, declare the returnName function definition as a method to the joe user object.

//Make a constructor function called Pet that will create an object with a name property, a species property, and a color property.
//Add a method called log on your constructor that will console.log the pet's name, species, and color.
function Pet(name, species, color) {
	this.name = name;
	this.species = species;
	this.color = color;
	this.log = function() {

//Using the Pet constructor, create three new Pet objects passing in the species, breed and color of your favorite pets (or make some up).
//Store them in variables.

var pet1 = new Pet("name1","species1","color1");
var pet2 = new Pet("name2","species2","color2");
var pet3 = new Pet("name3","species3","color3");

//Invoke the log method on each new pet object.

pet1.log()

//Create a function called shopping. Put the cart array (found below) inside of the function.
// var cart = ['carrots','almonds','milk','honey'];

function shopping(cart) {

	var cart = ['carrots','almonds','milk','honey'];

}

//Now uncomment the console.log below and notice that cart is not defined.
console.log(cart)


//This is because cart is essentially a private variable within the shopping function's scope and is not accessible outside of it.
//How could we make it possible to modify or access that cart array from somewhere else in our code?
//We can use something called the Module Pattern. You can read more about that here: https://toddmotto.com/mastering-the-module-pattern/



//In your shopping function, return two methods. One will be called getCart and the other will be called addToCart.
//getCart will return the cart array and addToCart will take in an item as a parameter and add it to the cart array.

var shopping = (function() {

	var cart = ['carrots','almonds','milk','honey'];
	var getCart = function() {
		return cart;
	};
	var addToCart = function(item) {
		cart.push(item);
	};
	return {
		getCart: getCart,
		addToCart: addToCart
	};

})();

//Invoke the getCart method and console.log the response.
//Invoke the addToCart method, passing in an item as an argument.
